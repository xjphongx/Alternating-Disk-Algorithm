## Project Description
In this project, I was given the task to analyze two algorithms: Left-to-Right Algorithm and Lawnmower Algorithm. This project description includes complete functionality of the running skeleton code provided by our professor, formatility of the report and github presentation, and a complete analysis of the algorithmâ€™s efficiency class. Everything is up-to-date and uploaded on to my Github repository.
