Algorithm Design

This text file will contain the psuedocode 
for the Left-to-Right and Lawnmower Algorithm.

Left-to-Right 

Parameter: before vector
Create a temp object = before vector

for i=0 to size do
    for j=0 to size - 1 do 
        if(current > next)
            swap current and next
            Increment counter

return sorted vector


Lawnmower

Parameter: before vector
Create a temp object = before vector 

for i=0 to (size/2) do
    for j=0 (size-1) do 
        if(current > next)
            swap current and next
            Increment counter
    for k=(size-1) to 0 do //counting down (-1)
        if(prev > current)
            swap prev and current   //prev goes first
            Increment counter

return sorted vector
